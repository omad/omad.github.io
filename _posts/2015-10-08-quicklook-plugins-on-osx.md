It's cleanup time on my Mac, and the [Quick Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) `<Spacebar>` feature in _Finder_ is essential for sorting the keep from the delete. The default set of supported file-types is a little lacking, but there's plenty of extensions to fill the gaps. Here's a list of what I use.

###[QuickLook-CSV](https://github.com/p2/quicklook-csv)
For all your text based tabular data viewing needs.

    brew cask install quicklook-csv


###[QLMarkdown](http://inkmarkapp.com/markdown-quick-look-plugin-mac-os-x/)

    brew cask install qlmarkdown


###[QLStephen](http://whomwah.github.io/qlstephen/)
An odd name, but this one is handy for viewing text files like `README` and `LICENCE` files that have no extension.

    brew cask install qlstephen

### [QuickLook JSON](http://www.sagtau.com/quicklookjson.html)
    brew cask install quicklook-json


### [QuickNFO](https://github.com/planbnet/QuickNFO)
    brew cask install quicknfo

### [BetterZip Quick Look Generator](http://macitbetter.com/BetterZip-Quick-Look-Generator/)
Preview inside `zip` files without needing to extract them.

    brew cask install betterzipql
