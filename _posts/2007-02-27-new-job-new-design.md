<img src="http://omad.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/myni.jpg" alt="MyNight Logo" style="border: 2px solid black; margin: 8px; float: right" />Last week I finally started work again after only about 3 months holiday. I&#8217;m not helping a Brisbane based web startup called MyNight. Everything&#8217;s going well so far, and it&#8217;s great not to be sitting around the house any more.

I&#8217;ve also changed the layout of my site. Hopefully only temporary (hah), and just a stock theme, but at least not THE stock theme.
