I&#8217;m back home now, after my two month summer climbing holiday taking in the best Australia has to offer. Starting out in the Blue Mountains in a house with [QUT Cliffhangers][1], then continuing on camping at numerous places before ending up at Arapiles. Australia&#8217;s climbing &#8216;Mecca&#8217;.

It&#8217;s actually been a week and a half since I&#8217;ve been home, not a lot to report.
