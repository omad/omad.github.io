This new book on typography gives a pretty great run-down on the basics, and beyond, on using text. Butterick does seem to push a little bit too hard on using his own fonts, so although the book is free, it feels like a big ad. The information is still very useful and sound.

Check outÂ [Practical Typography][1], by Matthew Butterick.

Another free web book published this year is [The Shape of Design][2] by Frank Chimero. It also manages to be beautiful, while living inside a web browser. It has no underlying sales message either.
