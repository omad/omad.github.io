Google emailed me this morning, letting me know this site had been hacked. My first thought was Scam. But on closer inspection, someone had indeed modified every php file here to spread the infection and redirect people to unfriendly websites.

It is entirely my fault, for not changing passwords when my web host told me to. But it&#8217;s also a wakeup call about how much badness there is on the internet.

Everything is fixed now, and might even serve as an incentive to post a little more regularly. Seems unlikely however.
