The lunch and sweeps organised at work today for the [Melbourne Cup][1] were too much effort, so I&#8217;m now home for lunch. I&#8217;m not going to watch the race here either, thanks to an allergic reaction to the advertisement for &#8216;[Dancing with the Stars][2]&#8216;, and then the painfully inane statistics being spouted by [Bruce McAvaney][3].

Instead I&#8217;ll sit here enjoying my pasta lunch listening to the tuneful melodies of The Shin&#8217;s latest album.
