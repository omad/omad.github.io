No-one enjoys feeling stupid. Unfortunately that&#8217;s exactly the boat I&#8217;m in this morning. Once again I&#8217;m a victim of online fraud, only this time it&#8217;s thanks to stupidity and greed on my part.

For several months I&#8217;ve been interested in getting a newer video card than the lowly Geforce 2 MX I&#8217;m currently making do with. It mostly serves well, but I&#8217;d like dual-head, and a chance to play around properly with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Apple&#8217;s OS X</a>, neither of which it can do.

After deciding that an older <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ati.com/products/radeon9600/index.html">ATI Radeon</a> was my best bet, I found and paid for a second hand one through the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.overclockers.com.au/">Overclockers Australia</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://forums.overclockers.com.au/">Trading Forums</a>. Unfortunately, the card didn&#8217;t exist and the seller stopped responding to messages. I wasn&#8217;t the only one caught out, and the case is now being investigated by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.police.qld.gov.au/">Queensland Police.</a>

Not to be deterred, I took my search to [eBay][1], and found an absolute bargain on this <a target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;item=8816534263&#038;rd=1&#038;sspagename=STRK%3AMEWN%3AIT&#038;rd=1">Radeon 9800 Pro</a>. I took the usual precautions of buying on ebay, and checked the user feedback of the seller. At first glance it was very nearly all good, but when I looked closer, he had only been a member for three months, and had only sold cheap sets of batteries. Now he had listed many hundreds of dollars worth of computer gear, all finishing within a couple of days. I was suspicious, but decided, it&#8217;s eBay, what can go wrong, so bid, won, and paid for the item.

Today, the item hasn&#8217;t arrived, I check on eBay, negative feedback is starting to filter through, the seller is no longer a member, and I&#8217;m feeling very silly. It&#8217;s too soon for me to take any action, but it seems I&#8217;ll get to try out eBay&#8217;s disagreement services. Wonderful.

If something seems to good to be true. It probably is. Listen to your own common sense, don&#8217;t be as silly as me.
