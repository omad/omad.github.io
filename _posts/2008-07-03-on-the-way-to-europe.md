My big holiday begins!

It&#8217;s 2am in Singapore, the first stop off on my way to Italy, and I&#8217;m making use of the free internet facilities at the airport. That was the longest leg of the flight, the next two portions are each half an hour shorter. There&#8217;s sooo much to watch on the plane, but nothing can keep my attention, am going to try and sleep some more this leg.
