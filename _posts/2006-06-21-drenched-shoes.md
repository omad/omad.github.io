Brisbane has been fairly wet the last few days, and I&#8217;ve been having a fun time riding my bike around in it. My favourite thing is the wonderful reflections off the ground at night.

One problem however, is wet shoes. Ideally I should find waterproof shoes or covers, but I&#8217;m no-where near that sensible.  
The best technique for drying wet shoes (unless you have a fancy clothes drier with a shoe rack), is to place them upside down up at the back of the fridge. Warm dry air rises there, and your shoes will be ready to go the next morning.
