Is a very long time between posts. More than 10% of my life.

The trip I started in my last post was a resounding success. I rock climbed on 4 continents in 10 countries while travelling around the world. Celebrated the new year by sleeping in a snow cave on top of a mountain. Caught up with many old friends and made many new ones.

The time since then has been rather less exciting, but also much more relaxing.
