First task was to free up some space to move, and burning a few of the ripped DVDs would help a lot. I&#8217;ve managed before in linux, using the command line, but this time I wanted a GUI.

Low and behold, recent versions of K3b actually allow this, it was only a few months ago that I was foiled.

It&#8217;s nice when things (finally) just work!
